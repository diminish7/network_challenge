Still have quite a few photos from Berlin, so I am continuing with this series.\n\nI suppose Berlin in many ways is most famous for \'the\' wall.  It is certainly one of the sights that I wanted to see most.  There is in fact very little of it left.  This  large section just around the corner form Checkpoint Charlie, is now protected by a wire fence, to stop souvenir hunters from hacking further bits off.  Just around the corner a shady looking street trader tried to sell me a \'genuine\' piece of the wall. A novel way of recycling debris from local builders\' skips no doubt.  I had wanted to see Berlin for many years, since the first German I ever remember meeting was from there.  It was strange that coincidentally, my first trip coincided with the twentieth anniversary of the fall of the wall.  The wall seems to have been treated quite irreverently for such an important old lady.  They are building a museum/visitors centre on the other side of this bit of wall.  This will provide a more structured place for this historical monument.  In some ways, seeing the wall now is a bit of an anticlimax but in others, it it does make one ponder the misery and separation that it caused. The balloon is a tourist ride, it is tethered and it goes up and down.',NULL,'2009-10-17 00:00:00'),
